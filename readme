frist thing is create a function that need input the string array,
frist thing need to check the constraints in the function
i don't know words[i] consists of lowercase English letters is a checking or just prefer value
if it is checking can add regex checking inside words.every(word => 1 <= word.length && word.length <= 100)
such as the regex is /[a-z]/ then use regex.test(word)
after all constraints the should loop the string array to get every word for compare
i change the sting to an array for using array method compare two array
if match char then add to new string
then use the new string to compare next array
and do it recursive
